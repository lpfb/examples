#> C language rsyslog basic example
The code below will write the massafe "Test Massage 1" into syslog

#include <syslog.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    openlog("asteroids",LOG_CONS | LOG_PID | LOG_NDELAY, LOG_USER);
    syslog(LOG_INFO,"Test Message %d",1);
    closelog();
}

#> Adding massage filters
- It is possible to add filters on rsyslog system so that one can redirect log output to another specific file or even discard some massages

IMPORTANT:
- All operations below involve modifications in RULES section of /etc/rsyslog.conf
- After modify rsyslog.conf, you MUST restart rsyslog using below command:
    $ sudo service rsyslog restart

> Filtering massages from a specific application
    - Discarding massages from an application
        - Syntax: :programname, isequal, "appname" ~
        - Where appname needs to be the target application name, " must be included
    - Redirecting massages from an application to another log file
        - Syntax: :programname, isequal, "appname" /var/log/<desired file name>.log
        - Where appname needs to be renamed to the target application name, " must be included, and <desired file name> must renamed to the desired log file name

> Filtering massages in general
    - Discarding massages that contains a string pattern
        - :msg, contains, "test message to discard"    ~
            - "test message to discard" can be any desired string
