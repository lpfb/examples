========================================================
                    Basic concepts
========================================================

# Initialize a repository
    > Using this command inside a folder, we will create a local git repository. A folder called ".git" will be placed into the mentioned folder. Removing this ".git" we remove the entire git local repository management.
    $ git init

# Ignoring files on git
    1- Creates a file called ".gitignore"
    2- Put all the file names that you don't want to be versioned into this file
    > Git recognizes wildcards: Ex: *.py 
    > You must add one item per line

# Git stages
    > Git has three different stages, they are:
        - Working Directory: local repository containing your modified files
        - Staging Area: When we add a new file to git, this file will be in this area, ready to be committed
        - .git Directory: After the commit, the files goes to the local “.git” repository

========================================================
                    Commands
========================================================
# Cloning a remote repository
    $ git clone <url> <where to clone>


# Showing the status
    > There two basic forms to do this:
        - Show untracked and tracked files of the current branch
            $ git status
        - Show just tracked files of the current branch
            $ git status -uno

# Showing git configurations
    $ git config --list

# Removing files
    > Removing a file from the Staging Area
        $ git checkout <file-name>
    > Removing all untracked files
        - This command remove from the disk all files that are not versioned, so beware of it before use this command. The -d option is to remove directories also.
        $ git clean -fd

# Git Stash
    > Adding modified files to stash list
        $ git stash
    > Applying stashed files into current change and removing it from stash list
        $ git stash pop
    > Applying stashed files into current change but does not removing it from stash list
        $ git stash apply

# Adding new files or files that has been changed
    > Every time that you want to submit a new or a modified file(s) it will be necessary to use this command. After this, the files will be transferred from your working area to your tagring area.
    > Add all
        git add -A
    > Add a single file
        git add <file name>
    > Add all files modified and ignore untracked ones
        git add -u

# Reverting/Removing a local file changes
    > Removing add changes from stage area
        $ git checkout -- <file name>
    > Unstage files
        - This command unstage the local commit and files, but does not remove them
        $ git reset --soft HEAD^
    > Remove a local commit and go back to the master, remove files
        $ git reset --hard origin/master 
            OR
        $ git reset --hard <COMMIT -ID>
            * This is the ID given with the command: git log --oneline

# Commiting changes
    > Committing added changes/files
        - Passaing a massage
            $ git commit -m "your message here"
        - Editing the massage on deafult editor
            $ git commit

    > Committing and adding with a single step
        - Executing “git add” and “git commit -m "your message here" in a single command
            $ git commit -a -m "your message here"
        - Executing a "git add" and "git commit" in a single command
            $ git commit -a

    > Amending a commit
        - This command sends a new patch to the last change ID used in the previous git push ~.
            $ git commit --amend

# Showing commit logs
    > Seing log of a specific commit
        $ git log <commit hash>
    > Seing commit log's in one line
        $ git log --oneline --decorate
    > Seing commit log's and branch's as a graph on terminal
        $ git log --graph --all --decorate --oneline
        $ git log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative --all --decorate



# Git Diff
    > This commands will display the differences between the local version and the version that is in the remote repo on the screen
        $ git diff
    > You can also use the merge tool pointed out at your git config global:
        $ git difftool <ver1 ver2>

# Branchs
    > Showing local and remove branchs
        - This command does not search for remote upgrades. To reflect the current state of the remote branchs, run "git pull" before.
            $ git branch -aavvvvvv

    > Checking out a branch to work on it
        $ git checkout <branch name>
        
    > Checking out a not yet merged commit/patch set - METHOD ONE
        0- Navigate to the git repo using terminal
        1- Click on desired git commit on git web brownse and than click in (...) at the right side of page, by the side of EDIT
        2- Copy "Download patch set" command, ex: git fetch "ssh://tc.lbarros@gerrit.padtec.com.br:29418/fw/tools/AtualizadorFw" refs/changes/73/26573/3 && git checkout FETCH_HEAD
            - After this step, you will have a branch deatached from any other branch.
        3- Paste it into the terminal
        4- Finally: git checkout -b <desired branch name>
        After all this steps, you will be able to merge, rebase, send another patch set and etc
        
    > Checking out a not yet merged commit/patch set and syncronize it with a branch - METHOD TWO
        0- Navigate to the git repo using terminal
        1- Checkout the same parent commit used by the commi not yet merged
        2- Click on desired git commit on git web brownse and than click in (...) at the right side of page, by the side of EDIT
        3- Copy "Pull" command, ex: git pull "ssh://tc.lbarros@gerrit.padtec.com.br:29418/es/proj/roadm_vybrid/lib/devices" refs/changes/34/37734/3
        4- Paste it into the terminal
        After all this steps, you will be able to merge, rebase, send another patch set and etc

    > Synchronizing a local branch to the last version pointed in the remote repository without apply the modifications
        $ git fetch
    > Synchronizing a local branch with its correspondent remote
        $ git pull
    > Synchronizing a local branch before commit with its correspondent remote
        $ git pull --rebase
        
    > Creating a branch from current branch HEAD version
        $ git branch <branch name>
    > Creating a local branch from a specific change of git
        $ git branch <branch name> <commit hash>
    > Creating a local branch and synchronizing it with the the remote branch:
        $ git checkout -b <branch name> origin/<remote branch name>
        
    > Merging branchs
        $ git checkout <branch name>
        $ git merge <branch-name to be merged>
        
    > Solving merge conflicts
        $ git mergetool
        
    > Renaming a local branch
        $ git branch -m <new name>
        
    > Removing branchs
        - Removing a local branch
            $ git branch -d <branch name>
        - Removing <branch-name> from remote repository
            $ git push origin --delete <branch-name>

    > Reverting a remote commit already merged
        - This process will create a new commit that will undo the changes applied by the commit that you want to be reverted.
            * After the above process, it is necessary to send the modification to the remote branch, ex: git push origin master
            $ git revert <commit_hash>
            
    
    > Sending changes to the remote repository
        - Send modificatioins on <branch name> to its correspondent remote branch without pass through gerrit/bibucket check
            $ git push origin <branch name>
        - Send local modifications on <branch name> to gerrit review
            $ git push origin HEAD:refs/for/<branch name>
    
# Tags
    > Creating a tag based on current branch HEAD version
        $ git tag -a <tag version/name> -m "Message here"
    > Creating a tag based on a specific branch change/revision
        $ git tag -a <tag version/name> <revision base, ex: 9fceb02> -m "Message here"
        
    > Pushng a single tag
        $ git push origin <tag_name>
    > Pushing all local tags to the remote repository
        $ git push --tags

    > Show all the tags
        $ git tag
    > Checkout a tag to a local branch
        $ git checkout -b <branch name> <tag version/name>
