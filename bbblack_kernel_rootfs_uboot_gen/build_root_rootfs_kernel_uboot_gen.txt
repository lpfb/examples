Buildroot instalation
1. Download buildroot: https://buildroot.org/download.html
2. Extract it

Interesting directories:
- configs: board _defconfig files
    - Beaglebone files: ls -l | grep beagle
    - beaglebone_defconfig will be used
- board: contains the list of supported buildroot boards
    - Beaglebone black: board/beaglebone
        - Contains configurations and linux patchs necessarys in order to use beaglebone board
        - readme.txt: informs wich boards are supported by this folder, informs output files and how to compile the complete project (uboot, kernel, rootfs)
        
Required packages in order to compile:
- sudo apt-get install cpio unzip rsync
        
Building entire system
1. Enter in buildroot directory
2. Generate board default configuration file
    * make beaglebone_defconfig
3. Configure what will be generated
    * make menuconfig
    1. It is necessary to inform the path of downloaded 
    x. Using custom git repository: https://github.com/beagleboard/linux
        - It is necessary to inform the desired version(tag)
    x. Informas wich board configuration file will be used:
        - For linux < 4.11, use bb.org
        - For linux >= 4.11, use omap2plus
    x. inform load address: 0x80008000
4. compile kernel
    * make -j4
    * IF this erro appear:
        *** Maybe you need to increase the filesystem size (BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_EXT2_SIZE)
        just: with 'make menuconfig' --> 'Filesystem images' --> 'exact size'
        and change it's value to 200MB
    * If this erro appear: ERROR: file(zImage) /ERROR: vfat(boot.vfat): could not setup zImage
        Jus ignore it

As a result, the generated outputs will be stored at:
    -> buildroot-2021.05/output/images
    
Possibly boot errors:
-> fsck: error 2 (No such file or directory) while executing fsck.ext4 for /dev/mmcblk1p1
-> fsck exited with status code 8
    - Correction:
